# Electric Vehicle Searcher
This tool is used to query the Edmunds API for vehicle information and display raw json data for all vehicles that have electric motors. 
### Notes
- Please add your own API key to [appsettings.json](https://github.com/ms-edm/Edmunds-FC/blob/master/src/ElectricVehicleSearcher/appsettings.json)
- DEBUG compilation will use test data for debugging purposes, RELEASE mode will query the Edmunds API for real data. This is explained in more detail as part of the documentation to my submission.
